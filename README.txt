How to reproduce results: 

All the code provided will output the results from the HW. I only made changes in featurize.py and the .ipynb notebook. However, I will say that I did add the scripts/load.py file to my notebook and edited it so that I could get the data. I also changed the data variable to load all the .npz files from where the hw1 zip file was downloaded to in my laptop. As a result, it loads from the file path that hw1 is located on my laptop so you would have to change that in order for it to load like it does on my end. After this is completed, running the notebook in order will produce the same results.

For featurize.py, the code I used is in the file featurize.py attached to the homework submission.
