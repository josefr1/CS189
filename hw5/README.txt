How to reproduce results: 

To get same results as in the notebook, I used random seed given in decision_tree_starter.py skeleton[random.seed(246810), np.random.seed(246810)]. I also used custom file path on my local laptop for pulling the data(/Users/jose/Downloads/hw5/...) so be wary of changing that when loading the datasets in. Everything else should run as normal. Random forest classifier did error on the notebook so that portion wont work for titanic specifically but spam will.
