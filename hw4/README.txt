How to reproduce results: 

To get same results as in the notebook, I set a random seed to 189004 and loaded the data.mat file from where it was located in my laptop directory([deleted]) so you would have to take both of those into consideration when attempting to reproduce the results. Other then the random seed and loading the data, everything else should work on the notebook itself. The coding appendix has both the code in this notebook as well as the code I changed in decision_tree_starter.py which could also be found in the python file itself for better visibility.
